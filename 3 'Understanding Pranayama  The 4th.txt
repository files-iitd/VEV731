3 'Understanding Pranayama : The 4th Anga' by Sri M


In this video, Sri M discusses the fourth Anga of Yoga, pranayama. He explains that pranayama means rules and regulations regarding prana, which is the life energy that includes oxygen and digestive energy. There are four types of pranas in the system, which are Khana, Apana, Udana, and Samana. Pranayama can only be connected to prana through suasa, which is our breath, and breath is intimately linked to prana. Pranayama helps to supply more oxygen into the lungs, and deep yogic breathing is like a deep, full breath that does not necessarily mean taking a deep breath from the throat. Sri M demonstrates how to do the simple pranayama technique of apana breathing, which involves taking a deep breath and pushing it into the stomach, then breathing out fully through both nostrils. He explains that there are many channels in the body through which prana operates, and the three most important ones are Ida, Pingala, and Sushumna. To balance the Ida and Pingala, you can manipulate the left and right nostrils, respectively.

The transcript is about Pranayama, which is a central practice of Kriya yoga. Sri M explains that deep breathing and silent hums while breathing in and out are good practices for pranayama. The practice of meditation, particularly Vipassana, which is the awareness of breath, is also discussed. The transcript also talks about the importance of observing one's breath as it is the most important thing in one's life and the link to the inner mind. Sri M notes that emotions are reflected in breath and watching one's breath can lead to a beautiful meditation.
