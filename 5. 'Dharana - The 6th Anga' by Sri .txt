The video discusses Dharana, the sixth Anga of Astanga-yoga/Kriya, which is derived from the Yoga Sutras. The concept of Ishwara in yoga is derived from Sankhya and is not a Creator God. The practicals of yoga include Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, and Pratyahara. Asana is defined as the situation where there is continuous and permanent happiness, and savasana is necessary to derive the effects of the practice. Savasana is not merely lying down like a shava, and it involves tensing and relaxing the muscles.

In the video "Dharana - The 6th Anga" by Sri M, he explains the technique of Dharana which is to fix the internal attention in one place without movement. The simplest way to achieve this is to think of a beautiful Lotus in the heart and fix attention there. Another technique is to chant a mantra and visualize a deity. Sri M explains that Dharana can be applied with visual or sound techniques, and as the mind becomes quieter, internal sounds may be heard, which can lead to deeper levels of concentration. The goal of Dharana is to achieve a state of stillness and focus without distraction.
