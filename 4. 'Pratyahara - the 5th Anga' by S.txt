4. 'Pratyahara - the 5th Anga' by Sri M

In this video, Sri M talks about the fifth step of Ashtanga Yoga, which is Pratyahara. Pratyahara is the ability to selectively engage with the senses, both internal and external, and switch off and switch on at any given point. This is the preparatory stage for the development of Dhyana and Samadhi. Sri M gives an example of how to meditate properly, which involves switching off distractions and focusing on the task at hand. Additionally, he talks about Zen, which is a derivation of the word Ghan and the importance of understanding the basis of one's interest in it.
