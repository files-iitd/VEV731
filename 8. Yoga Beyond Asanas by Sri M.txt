8. Yoga Beyond Asanas by Sri M

The video discusses yoga beyond just physical asanas and explores the various texts and teachings of yoga. It mentions the importance of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali as the standard textbook of yoga and how the sutras need a commentary to open up. The speaker explains that Patanjali is depicted as half-snake and half-man, indicating the connection between the reptilian brain and yoga. The transcript also briefly touches on the connection between asanas and the spine.

The video discusses the limitations of our perception through our five senses and how it affects our understanding of the world. It mentions that different creatures with different senses perceive the world differently, and we cannot know the true form of the world. It also introduces the concept of samadhi in yoga, where one sees the world beyond its relative shape and existence. The transcript ends with a question about whether there are other parts of the mind or brain that are non-functional in ordinary life.
