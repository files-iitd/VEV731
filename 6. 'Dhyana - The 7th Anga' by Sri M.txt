6. 'Dhyana - The 7th Anga' by Sri M


The speaker is discussing Dhyana, which is a crucial step in meditation. Dharana is the first step, and Dhyana follows. Dharana is one-pointed attention, and Dhyana is an extension of this attention. However, it is difficult to achieve Dhyana without first following the proper steps, including Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, and Pratyahara. These steps must be followed before achieving Dhyana, and it is impossible to achieve Dhyana by simply living as one pleases and then sitting down to meditate.

Sri M talks about the concept of dhyana, which is the 7th Anga in yoga. He suggests fixing one's attention on something that sustains interest, like music or something enjoyable, and being open-minded while doing so. He also emphasizes the importance of understanding the foundation of dhyana and doing dharana on something that interests one for a length of time. Sri M also talks about the significance of understanding the breath and its connection to the source of life, prana. He advises to enjoy dharana and not worry about dhyana, as dhyana is a spontaneous process that occurs when dharana settles down and becomes lengthened.
