7. Samadhi - the 8th Anga by Sri M 

The video is about Samadhi, the eighth Anga in Yoga. Samadhi is a state of being where the actions of the mind are completely stopped, and there are no more fluctuations or conflicts. Reaching this state is called Samadhi, and it leads to freedom. The Yoga Sutra by Patanjali outlines the path to reach Samadhi, and it begins with understanding the aim of Yoga. The first section of the Yoga Sutra is called Samadhi Pada, which explains the aim of Yoga. The second section is called Sadhana Pada, which explains how to get there. The third section is called Vibhuti Pada, which explains the extraordinary capacities that come with experiencing Samadhi, and the fourth section is called Kaivalya Pada, which explains the ultimate result of having experienced Samadhi. There are different types of Samadhi, and it takes time and regular practice to reach this state.

Sri M discusses the concept of Samadhi, which is a state of deep concentration and meditation where the mind expands, and the practitioner becomes cut off from the outside world. Sri M explains that the ultimate goal of Samadhi is to discover the essential self, and that this can only be achieved through the process of Viveka and Vairagya. Viveka means discrimination between what is real and what is not real, and Vairagya means having no taste for things which are unreal. Sri M also explains that the practitioner must break away from all images, including the image of oneself, to attain Kaivalya or Moksha, which means freedom. The final state is one of being a witness or Sakshi, which is already free and alone, and there is nothing else to remain in the majesty of being.
