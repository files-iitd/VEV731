1. Yamas and Niyamas: The '1st and 2nd Angas' by Sri M - YouTube

In this video, Sri M discusses the importance of the Yamas and Niyamas, which are the first two Angas of Yoga according to Patanjali's Yoga Sutras. He emphasizes the need for practitioners to follow these rules and regulations as a base for their practice before moving on to higher levels such as Samadhi. Sri M also highlights the importance of purifying the mind and changing one's attitude and lifestyle before attempting to reach a state of Samadhi, as the mind must be free of distraction and ignorance. He cautions against the misconception that Yoga and Samadhi are easy practices and encourages serious and dedicated practice.

Sri M discusses the concepts of asteya, brahmacharya, and aparigraha, which are part of the Yamas. He explains how these principles can help individuals live a more fulfilling life and lead to inner peace by keeping the mind calm and quiet. Sri M also shares a story of a yogi sannyasi who mutilated his sex organs in an attempt to be free of sex but failed to overcome his desire for it. Sri M emphasizes the importance of practicing self-discipline and restraint in our activities to prevent the sense organs from running away with the mind. Ultimately, perfecting these principles can help individuals achieve the state of maharata, where they will not break these rules under any circumstances.
